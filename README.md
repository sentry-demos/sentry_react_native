## Versions

| dependency      | version
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| react-native     | 0.64.0  |
| gradle           | 6.7     |
| react           | 16.13.1    |
| sentry/react-native      | 2.4.0    |
| npx | 7.8.0 |
| cocoapods | +1.10.1 |

## Setup (Bootstrap)

[INSTALL.md](./Install.md) was written by the CreateReactNativeApp maintainers and outlines some things you'll need.

This step was already performed for adding the sdk to sentry_react_native, but it's good to know it was used as customers will use it:
```
$npx @sentry/wizard -i reactNative -p ios android
```
The above command launches the [Sentry wizard](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard) allowing you to [link](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/react-native/#linking) with the correct Sentry react-native project.
From our [documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/react-native/), the following changes happen which you should be aware of:
```
- add the sentry-android package for native crash reporting on Android
- add the sentry-cocoa package for native crash reporting on iOS
- enable the Sentry Gradle build step for Android
- patch MainApplication.java for Android
- configure Sentry for the supplied DSN in your index.js/App.js files
- store build credentials in ios/sentry.properties and android/sentry.properties.
```

## Setup

1. git clone git@github.com:sentry-demos/sentry_react_native.git
2. Add your DSN and BACKEND_URL for back-end to src/config.ts
3. `export const SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=<token>`
4. Setup a Android Virtual Device via AVD Manager.
5. If you don't have cocoapods or get an error about cocopods out of date, run `gem install cocoapods`
6. `npm install`
7. `cd ios && pod install`
8. Optional - Create a .env file in project root and add `SE=<value>`

Don't forget to bump your release version depending on platform
iOS: `Info.plist` `CFBundleShortVersionString`
android: `app.build.gradle` `versionName`

## Run

1. Android (optional) start the emulator by AVD Manager or:
```
// emulator executable is at /Users/<user>/Library/Android/sdk/emulator
emulator -list-avds
emulator @<YourEmulator> -dns-server 8.8.8.8
emulator @Pixel_3_API_30_x86_64 -dns-server 8.8.8.8
```

2. Run Ios or Android app
* _iOS  version_:
```
# opens the Metro debugger, has hot reload
npx react-native run-ios --configuration Debug

## builds a Release (takes longer)
npx react-native run-ios --configuration Release
npx react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone 11"
```
* _Android version_:
```
npx react-native run-android --variant Release
```
^ this command builds APK for the arch and installs to the emulator.
^ click 'OK' if you get a pop-up, and it should open Metro



## Expected Behavior

EmpowerPlant            |  Checkout
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![list of tools](./img/toolstore.png)  |  ![checkout cart](./img/cart.png)|

## Upgrade SDK path
1. npm install, then `cd ios && pod update` if `pod install` is failing. The pod updating depends on node_modules/@sentry/react-native being set.
2. Review previous PR so you know what to expect.

## Troubleshooting

#### Repo
This repo borrowed from [original react-native repo ]( https://github.com/sentry-demos/react-native/commit/269f58d63426065a4de67a3f22d2e774787cd996)
The following may have been borrowed: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `ios/Podfile`, `ios/Podfile.lock`, see [pull/2](https://github.com/sentry-demos/sentry_react_native/pull/2)

Please know that react-native generates it own [.gitignore file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49099131/recommended-gitignore-for-react-native/49099219
), which is of course part of this repo, so only those [autogenerated files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48448426/why-dont-we-gitignore-ios-and-android-in-react-native ) that are required for a baseline setup and the original demo code (files) are part of this repo.

Please see [Steps](#what-were-the-steps-again) or go through the [first ten commits](https://github.com/sentry-demos/sentry_react_native/commits/master) (and their git log) messages in chronological order, to see the exact commands that were run and what files that were autogenerated.

#### What were the steps again
This is just the background steps to answer "How did we get here ?" . Below is not needed/related to the demoing this app.
```
// generates boilerplate code
npx react-native init sentry_react_native
cd sentry_react_native
cd ios
// Edit Podfile to remove/comment out flipper install as suggested in the comments of the file itself
pod install
// add Sentry SDKs
npm install --save @sentry/react-native
npx @sentry/wizard -i reactNative -p ios android (and select you Sentry react native project )
cd ios
pod install
```

#### adding Sentry for first time
When running npx @sentry/wizard -i reactNative -p ios android
At this point, you may get an error like:
`TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "data" argument must be of type string or an instance of Buffer, TypedArray, or DataView. Received undefined`
It should be safe to look past this error. A minor issue is that it blocks creation of `ios/sentry.properties`. So simply make a copy of `android/sentry.properties` and put it in `ios/sentry.properties`:
```
cp andoid/sentry.properties ios/sentry.properties
cd ios
pod install
```

If all else fails and you seem to be getting a weird error related to IllegalAccessErrors or anything else you may need to rebuild your Android and iOS folders using the following (just make sure to grab the sentry.properties files, build.gradle files, and pod files from Github afterwards):

```
sudo rm -rf android/ ios/
yarn add react-native-eject
npx react-native eject
```

#### Emulators
When running emulator...
If the app launches and suddenly crashes you may need to reinstall your node package with this command:

```
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

Emulator needs  Internet access enabled on your Android emulator. Use AVD Manager or:

#### Running
You may run into issues if you haven't added sdk and sdk platform-tools to path:
`export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/Users/<user>/Library/Android/sdk`
`export PATH=/Users/<user>/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:$PATH`

"error: Can't find the 'node' binary to build the React Native bundle." should be okay

If tools don't load, then swipe-away (kill) the app, then relaunch from app menu in the emulator. If still fails, then go to AVD Manager and 'wipe' the device and run the emulator again.
Could also be a problem with the backend container/app you're requesting the tools from (check that URL/Postman, check TDA job)

When developing locally, must point React Native to http://127.0.0.1:8080/products backend instead of https://localhost:8080/products backend.

# How To Create a Release

You must complete all of the following steps when setting a new release version:

## 1. Tick the release version forward.

There is only one command needed here:

```
$ npm version patch
```

This:
- Increments version by 0.0.1, i.e. `2.0.1` -> `2.0.2`.
- Automatically keeps versioning consistent across package.json and associated android and ios files
- Automatically creates a commit for the newly created release, i.e. `2.0.2`

You should see:

![Screen Shot 2021-12-08 at 12 42 36 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12092849/145281424-5900b190-4369-4607-ac2d-b4a317e28eea.png)

We can run `git log` to confirm that the release commit for `2.0.2` was created:

![Screen Shot 2021-12-08 at 12 59 35 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12092849/145283580-5b6186c7-4861-46b9-a6f0-0dfa8d20db58.png)

Be careful about which project you are pointing to when you start ticking releases forward or triggering them. Note that once you tick the release version forward locally (i.e. to `2.0.2`), if you locally trigger an error, the Sentry project you're pointing to will start reporting that error as associated with release `2.0.2` (even though your code is being run locally and is technically not deployed). Such are the dangers of having a demo app's release process not occur during a typical release pipeline.

The `npm version patch` command automatically keeps releases consistent across `package.json`, `Info.plist`, and `build.gradle` thanks to [react-native-version](https://github.com/stovmascript/react-native-version).

## 2. Create a Github Release

It's also crucial that we create a Github release so that our automated test jobs (located in the [application-monitoring repo](https://github.com/sentry-demos/application-monitoring/tree/master/tests)) can create data in Sentry based on the latest react native code.

What’s the purpose of this? 

Basically in the Github releases, we want to make sure certain artifacts are uploaded. For example in this release I did, 1.9, we have .apk and .app.zip artifacts uploaded. The generated artifacts will be uploaded to the Github Release we create. Then, our automated ‘TDA’ (test data automation) tests will use these builds of the app to generate data and populate our Sentry demo projects.

This is a guide of how to build those artifacts and create a Github Release, while uploading the relevant artifacts along with the release.

### Generate Release/Debug Artifacts

(:pencil2: I'm hoping to make this a less manual process in the future so that you can just run one or two scripts. Unfortunately some things I haven't figured out about Xcode are preventing that. -Chris)

First: ensure your local repo is up to date with the Github `master` branch via `git pull origin master`.

#### iOS

1. Generate the Release build
- `cd` into the root repository directory - `sentry_react_native`
- Run `npx react-native run-ios --configuration Release`. This will start the iPhone simulator and launch the app but we don’t care about that -- this command also creates the release build. 
- This will result in a directory being populated under /Users/cstavitsky/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData (replace cstavitsky with your local username). There will be a sentry-react-native-<bunch of random chars> directory. You will see it output once the `npx` command above completes:

<img width="1792" alt="Screen Shot 2021-12-21 at 9 28 06 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12092849/147010734-a3ef72b0-8f4f-4ee5-9eca-a569419d5a0e.png">

- Copy the newly created release artifact into the current directory from the output (marked in blue underline above): `cp -r /Users/cstavitsky/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/sentry_react_native-dgoblbkgunhkxscqaagaqprvjqus/Build/Products/Release-iphonesimulator/sentry_react_native.app sentry_react_native.app` [your hash sentry_react_native-<....> will probably be different]
- Zip the copied directory so that the .zip can be uploaded along with the Github release: `zip -r sentry_react_native.app.zip sentry_react_native.app`
- If you do a `git status` you should see that `sentry_react_native.app.zip` was `modified`.
- Run `git add sentry_react_native.app.zip`

2. Generate the Debug build
- Run `npx react-native run-ios --configuration Debug`. This will start the iPhone simulator and launch the app but we don’t care about that -- this command also creates the debug build. 
- This will result in a directory being populated under /Users/cstavitsky/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData (replace cstavitsky with your local username). There will be a sentry-react-native-<bunch of random chars> directory.
- Copy the newly created release artifact (shown in output after running the `npx` command, similar to the Release screenshot above with filepath underlined in blue) into the current directory: `cp -r /Users/cstavitsky/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/sentry_react_native-dgoblbkgunhkxscqaagaqprvjqus/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/sentry_react_native.app sentry_react_native_debug.app` [your hash sentry_react_native-<....> will probably be different]
- Zip the copied directory `zip -r sentry_react_native_debug.app.zip sentry_react_native_debug.app`
- Run `git add sentry_react_native_debug.app.zip`

### Android
  
1. Generate the Release build
- Run `npx react-native run-android --variant Release`. This will generate the Android release build. Ignore the emulator.
- Copy the release build to the root directory of the project: `cp android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk ./`
- Run `git add app-release.apk`
  
2. Generate the Debug build
- Run `npx react-native run-android --variant Debug`. This will generate the Android debug build. Ignore the emulator.
- Copy the debug build to the root directory of the project: `cp android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk ./`
- Run `git add app-debug.apk`

Create a Github Release:

Note: do not proceed with this until you have done all the previous steps.

1. (If this is your first time doing this, run `brew install gh` to install the Github CLI tool. Once you install it, you can skip this step in the future)
2. Commit the four files `git commit -m “Add release artifacts”`
3. Run the release script `./github_release.sh`, and select yes when prompted.

Your new release should be [visible on Github](https://github.com/sentry-demos/sentry_react_native/releases).

### [Troubleshooting - Locally undoing an accidental increment of the release version]

If you accidentally tick the version forward by running `npm version patch`, and did not intend to do so, you can undo this.

Let's say we were previously on `2.0.1` and accidentally ran the command twice, ticking the release to `2.0.2` and `2.0.3`, but we only wanted to go to `2.0.2`.

- First, run `git log`.
- Copy the commit hash associated with the previous commit that you want to reset to.

![Screen Shot 2021-12-08 at 12 55 09 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12092849/145283369-2130cae7-fe0c-42ff-b826-0015c3cd565b.png)

- run `git reset <the commit hash>`.
- Check out any unwanted files that are no longer staged for commit.
